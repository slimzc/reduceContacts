Testing reduce filter in contact (test for NativeScript-Contact-Lite)
Just for fun! 😁

### Install

npm install
```

### run
```
npm run test
# or

The output in console show hte time of excecute 100 times each method.
first method use Javascript High Order Functions (HOF), the other one a chained for cycle.

I need test it with a bigger dataset of contact.
